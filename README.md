## How to install:

1. Download this repo
2. Open src/config_example.yml and add UID and SECRET codes
3. Check that you have docker installed. If you do not, you can find instructions on how to install an run docker at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
4. Run the installation and running script with `./run.sh` (tested on Debian and osx)
5. On most osX and Linux machines the script will open the page for the user interface automatically. If that is not the case, open http://localhost:6660 on your browser
6. If the page does not load, wait for the docker to be finished building and running the app, and hit refresh
